* TicTacToe
This is a Python implementation if TicTacToe, using Bitboards.

* Usage
** Clone a Copy and run the test
#+BEGIN_SRC
$ git clone https://github.com/afue/TicTacToe.git
$ cd TicTacToe
$ chmod +x bin/run
$ bin/run --test
#+END_SRC

** Play a game
~bin/run~

* Design Choices
** Bitboards
- Three 9-bit bitboards are used: First player, second player and occupied cells
- One 32bit (or more) integer is enough to save all these
- No boundary nor type check done on bitboard functions, only on the string interface

** Engine Interface
- Use strings to interact between user and Engine
- No use of exceptions, use Boolean when function call can fail

** Test Cases
- Use assert statements for test cases
